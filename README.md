Key: (13-11+1)x12 = 24

**Overview:**

Name: 24

Game Introduction: Make the number 24 from the four numbers on a game card. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide. Use all four numbers on the card, but use each number only once.

Example: 3 4 5 6 Solution: (5-4+3)x6

Section1_Game: Play the game, and get total time counted, you can see your rand based on your total time.

Section2_24Calculator: Calculate if 4 number could get 24, for example 1,1,1,1 cannot result in 24.

Section3_Collection: While the user playing, every round there'll be a timer, and every combination will have it hard level counted thereafter, i.e. the average time consumption on the combination will be the degree of difficulty; there will be a collection of the twenty most difficult combinations.


**Data Model:**

The application will store: Player Result, Combination's Average Time;

Player Result: After the game, the player could leave their name, and his result will be compared with other players and get his rank.

Combination's Average Time: There will be 5 rounds in one game. Every round, the server will randomly choose 4 cards for the user, how many times has this combo been generated and the average time for the card set to be solved will be stored.

An Example of Player Result:
```
{
    username: "AlextheGreatest",
    time: "100.0s"
    round_time:{[3,3,7,7]:20.5 , [2,4,7,4]:10.5 , [6,6,3,11]:38.7 , [8,3,3,8]:30.3},
}
```
An Example of Combination's Average Time:
```
{
    combination: [3,3,7,7],
    times: 3,
    average_time: 40.4s
}
```
